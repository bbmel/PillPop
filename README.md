# PillPop

https://devpost.com/software/pillpop-qi39ey

We decided to create PillPop after we noticed that our elderly relatives had to be reminded by our parents to take their pills. We thought...why not make that process automated?

The app allows a signed up user to manage when his/her loved ones receive an automated call or text reminding them to take their medications using the Twilio API. When a loved one is sent a text or called, he/she must confirm that he/she has taken his/her medications by sending a response text or by pressing a number on his/her telephone. The app then generates a score that measures how consistent your loved one is in taking his/her medications.

We built the app with Swift and coded a custom user login page using a Parse server. We plan on making this app run seamlessly by July 2018 and launching it in the app store.
