# PillPop

https://devpost.com/software/pillpop-qi39ey

Inspiration
We decided to create PillPop after we noticed that our elderly relatives had to be reminded by our parents to take their pills. We thought...why not make that process automated?

What it does
The app allows a signed up user to manage when his/her loved ones receive an automated call or text reminding them to take their medications using the Twilio API.

How we built it
We built the app on Swift using XCode and made our own custom Parse login/signup implementation. All graphics are from The Noun Project.

Challenges we ran into
We busted a mission learning the Twilio API and were still not able to integrate it into our app. Otherwise, everything else is working as intended.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our first hackathon! We are happy that we did not give up, and that we submitted something we are proud of.

What we learned
We learned how challenging, yet rewarding app development is. Our next hackathon will be much better after this experience since we know the steps to take.

What's next for Pillpop
We want to get the Twilio API integration to be fully functional, and for the app to run seamlessly. We are thinking about adding some more features.
